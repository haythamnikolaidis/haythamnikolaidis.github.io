author_bio: >-
  Over the years I have led an accomplished career as a <b>cross-platform mobile developer</b> with
  <b>9+ years’ workplace experience</b> in building, delivering, and maintaining full-stack solutions.
  I am currently serving as a <b>Senior Mobile Development Consultant</b> at Tangent Solutions and
  play a vital role in the Mobile Software Development Team’s client consultations on
  <b>Xamarin Forms</b>, <b>Native Android</b> and <b>iOS</b> solutions. Through my commitment to this role, I
  have helped multiple clients of Tangent Solutions improve their mobile app <b>delivery</b> to the
  app stores and stability of their mobile applications on end-user devices.<br/><br/>
  I love technology and the possibilities that it brings. I am currently completing my B.Sc. in
  Computer Science (specialising in Game Development) at the University of London. I am an
  avid supporter of <b>Open-Source</b> projects and in my spare time, I build video games using
  open-source software such as <b>Godot</b> (game engine), Blender and Pixelorama.<br/><br/>
  I am an open <b>communicator</b>, a <b>quick learner</b>, <b>objective</b>, unafraid of asking questions and
  willing to look for the best-suited solutions. I understand that <b>teamwork</b> and cultivating a
  collaborative atmosphere is essential to a project’s ongoing success. I thrive in areas where
  <b>innovation</b> and <b>creativity</b> are a must. I am loyal and have never been afraid of <b>hard work</b>.
  I’m inquisitive, intelligent and relish any opportunity to fix and solve problems.<br/><br/>
  I am <b>patient</b> and gentle-spirited, always willing to help, although when given an opportunity,
  I can be a creative comic and a little eccentric and fun. I am widely read and <b>knowledgeable</b>
  about a variety of different topics. I love to <b>explore</b> how and why things work and place
  great value on taking enough time to make sound decisions and exploring new creative
  avenues.<br/><br/>
  My other <b>passion</b> projects include <b>restoring</b> my vintage 1969 Mini car, <b>leading</b> a media team
  for video production, a live band and live stream broadcasts over the weekends. I also
  collect guitars, own a few pets and a house!
