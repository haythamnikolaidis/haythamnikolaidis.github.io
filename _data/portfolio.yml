author_bio: >-
  Over the years I have led an accomplished career as a cross-platform mobile developer with
  9+ years’ workplace experience in building, delivering, and maintaining full-stack solutions.
  I am currently serving as a Senior Mobile Development Consultant at Tangent Solutions and
  play a vital role in the Mobile Software Development Team’s client consultations on
  Xamarin Forms, Native Android and iOS solutions. Through my commitment to this role, I
  have helped multiple clients of Tangent Solutions improve their mobile app delivery to the
  app stores and stability of their mobile applications on end-user devices.<br/><br/>
  I love technology and the possibilities that it brings. I am currently completing my B.Sc. in
  Computer Science (specialising in Game Development) at the University of London. I am an
  avid supporter of Open-Source projects and in my spare time, I build video games using
  open-source software such as Godot (game engine), Blender and Pixelorama.<br/><br/>
  I am an open communicator, a quick learner, objective, unafraid of asking questions and
  willing to look for the best-suited solutions. I understand that teamwork and cultivating a
  collaborative atmosphere is essential to a project’s ongoing success. I thrive in areas where
  innovation and creativity are a must. I am loyal and have never been afraid of hard work.
  I’m inquisitive, intelligent and relish any opportunity to fix and solve problems.<br/><br/>
  I am patient and gentle-spirited, always willing to help, although when given an opportunity,
  I can be a creative comic and a little eccentric and fun. I am widely read and knowledgeable
  about a variety of different topics. I love to explore how and why things work and place
  great value on taking enough time to make sound decisions and exploring new creative
  avenues.<br/><br/>
  My other passion projects include restoring my vintage 1969 Mini car, leading a media team
  for video production, a live band and live stream broadcasts over the weekends. I also
  collect guitars, own a few pets and a house!
